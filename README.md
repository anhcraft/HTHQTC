# HTHQTC
My f***ing old web-game

HTHQTC was my old web-based-game. I created it to attend a competition.

I think it is useful for someone so I decided to make the source code publicly.

Noticed that this game was created when I started to learn code, I mean there will be some bugs and problem of grammar.

Enjoy!
